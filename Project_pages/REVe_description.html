            <h2> Description </h2>

            <p>
                This is a framework built using Python and Pygame-CE mostly, other significant modules<br>
                incule modernGL and Python's socket, threading, math, etc. modules<br><br>

                brief history of the framework. REVe was at first built to decrease the amount of boilerplate code<br>
                I had to write if ever I needed to build something. I then later started adding more and more stuff<br>
                to it and then it became what it is today.<br><br>

                So what can it do? Well it can:<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li> It allows one to create Simple or even complex GUI applications.</li>
                        <li> Thanks to the REVe.MGL submodule it allows you to create post-processing effects with the GPU</li>
                        <li> It has full compatabilitie with Pygame as it's a direct extention of Pygame-CE</li>
                        <li> Since it's built atop of Pygame-CE, it has support for Sound, User input and more.</li>
                        <li> It has a bunch of functions as well as built in functions to aid in development </li>
                        <li> And a bunch more stuff ... </li>
                    </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                You can get the source code for free <a href="../Assets/REVe.zip" style="color: gray" download>HERE</a>.<br>
                I recomend getting this framework if You have experience with Python and Pygame-CE.<br>
                I will create a PDF with all te necessary documentation ... Soon?!
